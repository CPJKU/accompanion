"""
This module contains a mediator for filtering out the MIDI messages 
"performed" by the ACCompanion from the input MIDI. Using the mediator
is only necessary for old instruments that do not filter the messages
automatically. So far we have only encountered this issue with the
BÃ¶sendorfer CEUS, and thus the name of the class.
